# Adjusting CPU Priority for a Process in WSL

When running resource-intensive applications or processes in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you may encounter performance issues due to CPU resource allocation. By adjusting the CPU priority of a specific process, you can allocate more CPU resources to it, potentially improving its performance.

## Steps to Adjust CPU Priority

To allocate more CPU resources to a process in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can use the `taskset` command along with the `nice` command to set the CPU affinity and priority of the process, respectively.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Identify the Process ID (PID) of Your Node Process:**
   You can use tools like `ps` or `top` to find the PID of your node process. For example:

```bash
ps aux | grep node
```

2. **Set CPU Affinity using `taskset`:**
   The `taskset` command allows you to set the CPU affinity of a process. You can use it to bind your node process to specific CPU cores. For example, to bind the process with PID `1234` to CPU cores 0 and 1:

```bash
taskset -cp 0-1 1234
```

3. **Set Priority using `nice`:**
   The `nice` command allows you to adjust the scheduling priority of a process. You can use it to increase the priority of your node process, giving it more CPU time. The priority values range from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). For example, to increase the priority of the process with PID `1234` by 5:

```bash
nice -n -5 1234
```

Be cautious when adjusting process priorities, as setting them too high may lead to system instability or unresponsiveness.

By combining these commands, you can allocate more CPU resources to your node process in WSL. Remember to replace `1234` with the actual PID of your node process.
